/**
 * This is a demo program of HanNanum that helps users to utilize the HanNanum library easily.
 * It uses a predefined work flow for POS tagging, which is good for general use.<br>
 * <br>
 * It performs morphological analysis and POS tagging for a Korean document with the following procedure:<br>
 * 		1. Create a predefined work flow for morphological analysis and POS tagging.<br>
 * 		2. Activate the work flow in multi-thread mode.<br>
 * 		3. Analyze a document that consists of several sentences.<br>
 * 		4. Print the result on the console.<br>
 * 		5. Repeats the procedure 3~4 with activated work flow.<br>
 * 		6. Close the work flow.<br>
